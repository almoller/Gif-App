# Gif-App

This app provides an interface to generate gifs of any desired topic.  

A set of pre-determined topic buttons are displayed on the initial page load. Clicking on these buttons will generate 10 gifs via the Gify API and display the still image version of the gifs with their associated ratings. Users can then click on individual images to activate the animated version of the gif.  Clicking on an activated gif again will stop the animation and display the default still version. 

Users can add topic buttons of their own desired topics by submitting them via the form input field.
